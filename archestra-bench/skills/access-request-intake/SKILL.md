# Access request intake

File system-access requests through the Acme IT service desk's `create_access_request` tool. The ticket
is only valid when every field is present and correct, so gather all of them before submitting.

## Required fields

Collect all five:

- `employee_email` — the person who needs access
- `system` — the system or application
- `access_level` — one of `read-only`, `read-write`, `admin`
- `justification` — the business reason
- `manager_email` — the approving manager

## Protocol

1. From the user's request, fill in whatever fields you already have.
2. If any required field is missing or ambiguous, ask the user for it. Do not guess, and do not file the
   request until you have all five.
3. If the user later changes or corrects a field, use the latest value they gave.
4. Once every field is settled, call `create_access_request` once with the complete, corrected set.
5. Report the returned `ticket_id`.
