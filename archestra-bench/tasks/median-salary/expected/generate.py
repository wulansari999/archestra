"""Generate the median-salary fixture: tasks/median-salary/inputs/salaries.csv.

Deterministic (fixed seed) so the committed fixture is reproducible. The CSV has name/department/
salary columns. Each numeric salary is rendered in one of several messy formats -- plain integer,
a dollar sign, thousands separators, a trailing `k` for thousands, or scientific notation -- so a
naive float() parse (or eyeballing the column) drops rows and gets the wrong median. Some rows are
also structurally malformed: a duplicated/misplaced comma shifts the salary out of its column, so a
column-indexed reader (csv.DictReader on `salary`) reads the wrong cell. A handful of blank /
non-numeric placeholder cells must be ignored. The median is taken over the numeric salaries only,
after normalizing every format and recovering the value regardless of which column it landed in.

Run:  uv run tasks/median-salary/expected/generate.py
