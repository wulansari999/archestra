"""Recompute the letter-count over the same surface the agent saw and compare to its submission.

Reads BENCH_STATE: `rest` holds the post-run snapshot of the agent's assigned tools
(`/api/agents/<id>/tools`) and the instance skills (`/api/skills`). Both endpoints expose the same
`name` field the agent counts, so truth here is defined identically to the agent's task -- no
hardcoded answer. The skills response is asserted complete (so a paginated overflow fails loudly
rather than silently undercounting). BENCH_RESULT carries the submitted count.
