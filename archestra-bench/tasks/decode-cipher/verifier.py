"""Verify the agent decoded the cipher by recovering the bespoke plaintext.

The plaintext is bespoke-cipher output, recoverable only by running the ciphertext through the
seeded `cipher-decoder` skill, so an exact match against the never-staged ground truth
(BENCH_FIXTURES/expected/plaintext.txt) is the real gate. We additionally require, from
BENCH_STATE, that the skill was loaded and seeded from the repo -- robust signals that the agent
engaged the skill and that the bench provisioned it correctly.
