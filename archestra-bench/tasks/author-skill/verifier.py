"""Verify the agent authored a skill AND triggered its bundled script to produce the answer.

Reads BENCH_STATE (the harness snapshot): `rest` holds the `/api/skills?search=...` response captured
after the run, and `tool_calls` holds the run's ordered tool invocations ({name, input}). The skill's
existence is backend state (not something the agent submits), and a run_command that referenced the
mounted `/skills/<name>` path proves the bundled script actually ran -- not merely that the skill was
created or mounted. BENCH_RESULT carries the submitted prime count.
