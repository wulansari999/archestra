# Entity mapping: source primitive → Archestra entity

This is the canonical mapping the model applies when turning `inventory.json` into
`migration_plan.json`. Each decision references an inventory item by `id` and names a
`target_kind`; `apply.py` builds the actual payload deterministically.

| Source (inventory `kind`) | `target_kind` | Confidence | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `claude_md` (root CLAUDE.md) | `agent` | clean | becomes the **primary agent**'s systemPrompt; one per setup, no model binding (inherits org default) |
| `skill` (`.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md`) | `skill` | clean | migrated verbatim with bundled files |
| `subagent` (`.claude/agents/*.md`) | `skill` (preferred) or `agent` | best-effort | default to skill; tool allowlist is **documented, not enforced** |
| `command` (`.claude/commands/*.md`) | `skill` | best-effort | slash command body → skill |
| `local_tool` (all `tools/*.py`) | `skill` | best-effort | ONE shared toolset skill bundles every script plus `requirements.txt`; see cross-references below |
| `mcp_server` (remote, has `url`) | `mcp_catalog` (+ optional `mcp_install`) | clean | remote catalog item |
| `mcp_server` (stdio, has `command`) | `mcp_catalog` (+ optional `mcp_install`) | best-effort | local catalog item; install spins a K8s pod |
| `hook` (intent `guard`) | `tool_policy` | best-effort, conditional | only if the guarded tool maps to a real Archestra tool — see below |
| `hook` (intent `passive`) | `manual` | report | logging/inject hooks have no Archestra equivalent |
| `openclaw` | `manual` | report | runtime config; schema unverified — report, don't translate |
| LLM key (user-provided) | `llm_key` | best-effort | user pastes the secret in `user_answers.apiKey` |
| telemetry (OTEL env, observability hooks, metrics-shipping scripts) | `manual` | report | no target — Archestra emits telemetry natively; redirect the collector (see "Telemetry" below) |

When you emit both a `mcp_catalog` and a `mcp_install` decision for the same server, they must share the
same `name`/`name_override`: the install resolves its catalog item **by name**, so a mismatch fails with
"no catalog item named …". `apply.py` runs all `mcp_catalog` ops before any `mcp_install`.

## Scope
Ask for ONE default migration scope up front (default `personal`); use per-decision overrides only as
exceptions. Keep the primary agent and its skills in the same scope so the agent can see them. If that
scope is `team`, agent/skill/catalog decisions must include `user_answers.teamIds`; MCP installs and
LLM keys must include `user_answers.teamId` (or exactly one `teamIds` value). Otherwise choose
`personal` or `org` instead. `apply.py` rejects team-scoped decisions without team ids before making
network calls.

## Skill visibility
After creating skills/agents, `apply.py` calls `POST /api/skills/enable-defaults` once, which enables the
org `archestra__{list_skills,activate_skill,read_skill_file}` tools and backfills them onto agents — that
is how the primary agent gains access to the migrated skills (there is no agent↔skill junction).
It also tries to assign sandbox tools (`run_command`, `upload_file`, `download_file`) to migrated agents
so bundled local tools can run from activated skills. Missing/disabled sandbox support is reported as a
non-blocking warning.

## Hooks → tool policies (the nuance)
A deterministic `PreToolUse` guard (e.g. "block Bash commands matching `rm -rf /`") maps exactly to a
tool-invocation policy: `{toolId, conditions:[{key,operator:"regex",value}], action:"block_always", reason}`.

But a policy attaches to a **tool that exists in Archestra**. Claude Code built-ins (Bash, Read, Write…)
are not Archestra tools, so a guard on `Bash` has no target. Therefore:
- The **model** must read the guard script and extract its semantics into `user_answers`:
  `{tool_name, key, operator, value, action?, reason?}`. (Parsing arbitrary guard code is judgment — do it.)
- `apply.py` resolves `tool_name` against `GET /api/tools`. If found → creates the policy. If not found
  (the common case for built-ins) → records `manual` with the ready-to-paste policy in the report.
- Policies only enforce when the org `globalToolPolicy` is `restrictive`. Tell the user; don't flip it silently.

## Telemetry & observability → leverage Archestra's native telemetry (report-only)
If the source ships its own telemetry, **don't migrate it** — Archestra already emits richer telemetry
natively and automatically: an OpenTelemetry span per LLM call and per MCP tool invocation, plus
Prometheus metrics (tokens, cost, latency, blocked-tools), with no per-agent setup. So a setup's
telemetry instrumentation is redundant. Map it to `manual` and, in the report, point the pilot owner at
the native capability instead.

Watch for telemetry in any of: an OTEL `env` block in `settings*.json` (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY`,
`OTEL_*`), hooks that POST spans/metrics to a collector, or plain `local_tool`/hook scripts that ship
metrics or logs. Naming won't always say so — read the body when a hook/tool looks observability-shaped.

Redirect, don't translate:

| Source telemetry | Use Archestra's instead |
|---|---|
| per-tool-call timing/usage hooks | OTEL span + Prometheus metrics per MCP tool call (automatic) |
| LLM token/cost logging | `llm_tokens_total`, `llm_cost_total`, `llm_request_duration_seconds` |
| custom OTLP exporter (env/hook) | native OTLP export via `ARCHESTRA_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` (`/v1/traces`, `/v1/logs`) |
| scraping a local metrics file | Prometheus `/metrics` on `ARCHESTRA_METRICS_PORT` (default `:9050`) |

Telemetry is **instance-level env config** — no API, no per-agent knob. To keep an existing
Grafana/collector, the pilot owner sets `ARCHESTRA_OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` on the instance.

## Local-tool cross-references (check before mapping)
Discovery emits a single shared toolset skill (`<project>-tools`) covering all `tools/*.py` and the
nearest `requirements.txt`. Other migrated skills/commands/subagents that tell the agent to run
`tools/<x>.py` keep that prose, but after migration the script lives in the toolset skill, not next
to them. For each such reference, ask the user whether to rewrite the body during mapping (preferred:
"activate the `<project>-tools` skill and run `python3 /skills/<project>-tools/tools/<x>.py`") or
leave it and list it in the report as a manual follow-up. Don't silently leave dangling references —
they fail with file-not-found at runtime.

The toolset name defaults to `<project>-tools`. `apply.py` treats an existing skill with the same
name/scope as already-migrated and skips it — so if an unrelated skill already holds that name, set
`name_override` on the toolset decision (and use the overridden name in any rewritten references),
or the local tools silently never migrate.

## Behavioral differences to put in the report
- **Subagent isolation & tool allowlists are not preserved.** Archestra skills are instructions, not
  isolated agents with enforced tool permissions. The migrated skill documents the original allowlist only.
- **Hooks** that log/inject/observe (SessionStart banners, PostToolUse logging) have no equivalent — list them.
- **Artifact/filename conventions** enforced only by prompt rules carry over as prose, not as code.
- **Local stdio MCP servers** are registered but only run if installed (opt-in) and resolvable in the cluster.

## Report (`report.md`)
Use `references/report-template.md`. The report should help a pilot owner decide what is ready to try
in Archestra, what was skipped or failed, and what still needs hands-on follow-up. Include behavioral
differences from the list above only when they apply to the actual migration.
