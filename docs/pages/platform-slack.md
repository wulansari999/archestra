Archestra can connect directly to Slack channels. When users mention the bot in a channel, messages are routed to your configured agent and responses appear directly in Slack threads.

## Prerequisites

- **Slack workspace** with admin permissions to install apps
- **Archestra deployment** — with external webhook access (webhook mode) or outbound internet access (socket mode)

## Connection Modes

Archestra supports two modes for connecting to Slack:

| | Socket Mode (default) | Webhook Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **How it works** | Archestra opens an outbound WebSocket to Slack | Slack sends events to your public webhook URLs |
| **Requires public URL** | No | Yes |
| **Best for** | Local development, firewalled environments, VPN setups | Production deployments with stable URLs |
| **Credentials needed** | Bot Token + App-Level Token + App ID | Bot Token + Signing Secret + App ID |

Choose the mode in the setup wizard (**Agent Triggers** → **Slack** → **Setup Slack**) or via environment variables.

## Setup

The setup wizard in Archestra guides you through the entire Slack configuration. Navigate to **Agent Triggers** → **Slack** → **Setup Slack** and follow the step-by-step instructions.

The wizard will walk you through creating a Slack app, installing it to your workspace, and configuring the connection mode. All required credentials are collected and saved automatically.

See [Deployment — Environment Variables](/docs/platform-deployment#environment-variables) for the full list of environment variables if you prefer manual configuration.

## Usage

### First Message

When you **first mention the bot** in a channel:

```
@BotName what's the status of service X?
```

The bot responds with a list of options to choose which agent will handle messages in this channel. After selection, the bot processes your message and **all future messages** in that channel.

### Replying within a thread

In channels the bot stays silent until it is @mentioned. Once mentioned in a thread, it keeps replying to every message in that thread without further mentions. Starting a new thread needs a fresh mention. Direct messages always get a reply, no mention required.

### Commands

Archestra uses native Slack slash commands — type them directly in the message box without mentioning the bot.
The command prefix is generated from the Slack app name in the setup wizard. The default app name uses:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/archestra-select-agent` | Change which agent handles this channel by default |
| `/archestra-status` | Show currently set default agent for the channel |
| `/archestra-help` | Show available commands |

### Default Agent

Each Slack channel requires a **default agent** to be assigned to it. This agent handles all messages in the channel by default. When you first mention the bot in a channel without a binding, you'll be prompted to select an agent from a dropdown.

You can manage the default agent for each channel from the **Agent Triggers** → **Slack** page in Archestra.

![Slack Agent Selection](/docs/select-agent-slack.webp)

Once set, the default agent processes all subsequent messages in that channel. You can also use the `/archestra-select-agent` command directly in Slack to change the default agent.

### Switching Agents Inline

You can temporarily use a different agent for a single message by using the `AgentName >` syntax:

```
@BotName Sales > what's our Q4 pipeline?
```

This routes the message to the "Sales" agent instead of the channel's default agent. The default binding remains unchanged—only this specific message uses the alternate agent.

**Matching rules:**
- Agent names are matched case-insensitively
- Spaces in agent names are optional: `AgentPeter >` matches "Agent Peter"
- If the agent name isn't found, the message falls back to the default agent with a notice

**Examples:**

| Message | Routed To |
|---------|-----------|
| `@BotName hello` | Default agent |
| `@BotName Sales > check revenue` | Sales agent |
| `@BotName support > help me` | Support agent |
| `@BotName Unknown > test` | Default agent (with fallback notice) |

### Direct Messages

A DM with the bot behaves just like another channel — each user can choose which agent handles their DMs. On your first message, the bot shows an agent selection card. Use `/archestra-select-agent` to change it later.

> The Slack app manifest already includes `im:history` and `message.im` scopes/events required for DMs.

## Autoprovisioning Slack Users

When a user interacts with the bot but hasn't signed up in Archestra yet, they are automatically provisioned with the **Member** role and no teams assigned. The user receives a unique invitation link via Slack DM that they can use to complete sign-up and become a full Archestra user. Until they do, they cannot log in to the Archestra web app.

Admins can view autoprovisioned users on the **Settings → Members** page — from there they can copy the invitation link or delete the user.

## Attachments

Messages sent to the bot can include file attachments (images, PDFs, documents, etc.). Attachments are automatically downloaded and passed to the agent for processing. Image attachments are included inline in the agent's context; non-image attachments are noted but not processed as inline content.

**Limits:**
- Max 20 attachments per message
- Max 10 MB per individual file
- Max 25 MB total across all attachments in a single message

Files exceeding these limits are silently skipped.

## Troubleshooting

**Bot not responding**
- Webhook mode: check webhook URL is accessible externally
- Socket mode: check backend logs for "Socket mode connected" message
- Confirm the bot is added to the channel

**"Request verification failed" (webhook mode)**
- Check that the signing secret matches the value on the Basic Information page
- Ensure server clock is synchronized (Slack rejects requests with clock skew)

**Socket mode disconnects**
- Verify the App-Level Token is valid and has the `connections:write` scope
- Check that the Archestra backend has outbound internet access
- The socket mode client auto-reconnects — check backend logs for reconnection attempts

**Missing channels**
- The bot must be invited to the channel first: `/invite @BotName`

**"Could not verify your identity"**
- Ensure `users:read` and `users:read.email` scopes are configured under OAuth & Permissions. Reinstall the app after updating scopes.

**"Slack is configured for Socket Mode" error on webhooks**
- This means Slack is configured to use socket mode but events are arriving via webhooks. Check that your Slack app has `socket_mode_enabled: true` in its settings, or switch Archestra to webhook mode.
