# Migrate to Archestra

> **Experimental.** The migration kit is new and still evolving.

The migration kit turns an existing agentic setup into an Archestra setup. Typical sources are the
unsorted configs left by tools like Claude Code, OpenClaw, or Hermes: project instruction files, MCP
configs, hooks, local scripts, and whatever else accumulated during evaluation.

It ships as a Skill (`migrate-to-archestra`) for your favorite coding agent (e.g. Claude Code), so the migration runs as a guided,
agentic flow rather than a one-shot script. The deterministic work — discovering source artifacts,
redacting secrets, building and validating API payloads — lives in zero-dependency Python helpers;
the model owns the judgment calls (what maps to what, what to skip, what needs review).

The goal is not a byte-for-byte port. It is to get the pilot running in Archestra quickly, with the
important behavior differences surfaced before anything is applied.

## What it produces

- A primary agent from the project's instruction file.
- Skills from existing skills, subagents, slash commands, and local tools.
- Private MCP catalog items, installed only on request.
- LLM provider keys, only when you paste the replacement secret.
- A report separating what moved, what was skipped, what failed, and what needs hands-on review.

## Install

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/archestra-ai/archestra/main/migration-kit/install.py | python3
```

The kit is zero-dependency (stock `python3` ≥ 3.10, standard library only), so the helpers run on
locked-down or air-gapped hosts. Then open Claude Code near the source project and ask it to use the
`migrate-to-archestra` skill against your Archestra instance.

## Flow

1. Connect to an Archestra instance, or start a local one (skill can help with that too).
2. Discover the source setup into a secret-redacted `inventory.json`.
3. Draft a preview plan and confirm the few decisions that matter (scope, which MCP servers to
   install, which keys to migrate).
4. Dry-run, then apply the approved plan.
5. Get a report with migrated items, manual follow-up, and behavioral differences.

## Typical migration plan

- **Subagents** become skills — instructions migrate, but isolation and tool allowlists are
  documented, not enforced.
- **MCP servers** become catalog items; installing them is opt-in because local stdio servers run
  inside Archestra's Kubernetes-backed runtime.
- **Guard hooks** become tool policies only when the target tool exists in Archestra.
- **Passive hooks, openclaw config, and unknown files** are reported for manual follow-up.
- **Telemetry/observability** is reported, not migrated: Archestra emits OpenTelemetry traces and
  Prometheus metrics natively (see [Observability](/docs/platform-observability)), so the report
  points you at that instead.

The full source, reference docs, and contributor tooling live in the
[`migration-kit/`](https://github.com/archestra-ai/archestra/tree/main/migration-kit) directory.
