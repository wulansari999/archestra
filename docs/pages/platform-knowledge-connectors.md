Connectors pull data from external tools into Knowledge Bases. A connector can be assigned to multiple Knowledge Bases. For direct document uploads, use **Knowledge > Files**; see the [Knowledge Files section](/docs/platform-knowledge-bases#files).

## Visibility

Each connector has a visibility setting that determines which users can retrieve its data when an agent calls `query_knowledge_sources`. Connectors and Knowledge Bases are filtered by visibility throughout the UI: users only see sources they have access to, and only those can be assigned to agents and MCP Gateways.

| Mode                      | Behavior                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Org-wide**              | All documents accessible to every user in the organization.                       |
| **Team-scoped**           | Documents accessible only to members of the assigned teams.                       |
| **Auto-sync permissions** | ACL entries synced from the source system (user emails, groups). Coming soon — see [#3218](https://github.com/archestra-ai/archestra/issues/3218). |

Users with the `knowledgeSource:admin` role can view and query every connector regardless of visibility.

> **Enterprise only.** Team-scoped visibility and auto-synced ACLs require an enterprise license. Contact [sales@archestra.ai](mailto:sales@archestra.ai) for licensing information.

When a multimodal embedding model is configured, image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) up to 4 MB are also indexed.

**Authentication:** an Azure AD app registration with client credentials (OAuth2). The app needs the `Sites.Read.All` application permission on Microsoft Graph, with admin consent granted.

| Field         | Description                                                                                       |

| Include Pages | Toggle to sync site pages and their web part content (default: on)                                |

Where to find each value:

- **Tenant ID** — **Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > <your app> > Overview > Directory (tenant) ID**.
- **Client ID** — Application (client) ID on the same page.
- **Client Secret** — the secret **Value** from **Certificates & secrets** (not the secret ID).
- **Site URL** — the exact SharePoint site web URL, not the display name.

## OneDrive

Text is extracted from `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.yaml`, `.log` files, as well as `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx` documents. When a multimodal embedding model is configured (e.g., `gemini-embedding-2-preview`), image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) up to 4 MB are also ingested and embedded directly.

| Field         | Description                                                                                                          |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| Client Secret | Azure AD app registration client secret value                                                                        |
| User IDs      | Comma-separated list of user principal names or object IDs whose OneDrive to sync (e.g., `user@company.com`)       |
| Folder ID     | Restrict sync to a specific OneDrive folder (optional -- find the ID from the Graph API or a drive item URL)         |
| File Types    | Comma-separated file extensions to include, e.g. `.pdf, .docx` (optional -- leave blank for all supported types)  |
| Recursive     | Traverse subfolders within each user's drive (default: on)                                                          |

Authentication uses an Azure AD app registration with client credentials (OAuth2). The app registration requires the `Files.Read.All` application permission on Microsoft Graph, and admin consent must be granted.

To configure the connector:

- `Tenant ID` comes from **Microsoft Entra ID > App registrations > <your app> > Overview > Directory (tenant) ID**
- `Client ID` comes from **Application (client) ID** on the same page
- `Client Secret` is the secret **Value** from **Certificates & secrets**, not the secret ID
- `User IDs` should be user principal names (UPNs, e.g. `user@company.com`) or Azure AD object IDs for the users whose drives you want to sync

Incremental sync uses the `lastModifiedDateTime` field to fetch only items modified since the last run.

### Known Limitations

- Only OneDrive for Business (work/school accounts) is supported. Consumer OneDrive is not supported.
- Syncs the personal drive (`/drive`) of each specified user; shared libraries are not traversed.

## Google Drive

Sync files from Google Drive (My Drive and Shared Drives).

**Indexed:** files from My Drive and Shared Drives. Supported document types include `.txt`, `.md`, `.csv`, `.json`, `.xml`, `.html`, `.htm`, `.yaml`, `.log`, `.docx`, `.pdf`, and `.pptx`. Google Workspace files (Docs, Sheets, Slides) are also indexed. When a multimodal embedding model is configured, image files (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`, `.webp`) are indexed too. Files larger than 10 MB are skipped.

**Authentication:** either a service account JSON key (recommended) or a short-lived OAuth2 access token with the `drive.readonly` scope. For a service account: create one in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), enable the Google Drive API, download the JSON key, and share the target folders or drives with the service account email. Paste the full JSON contents (or the bearer token) into the **Service Account Key / OAuth Token** field.

Sync CRM records from a Salesforce org.

**Indexed:** CRM records from a Salesforce org. By default the connector syncs `Account`, `Contact`, `Opportunity`, and `Case`. You can list other object API names in the **Objects** field, or use **Advanced Object Config JSON** to pick exact fields and associations per object.

**Authentication:** a Salesforce username, password, and security token. The password field must contain the password directly concatenated with the security token (no separator). To get the token: log in to Salesforce, click your **User Avatar > Settings**, then go to **My Personal Information > Reset My Security Token** and check your email.

| Field                          | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Login URL                      | Salesforce login endpoint (default: `https://login.salesforce.com`; use `https://test.salesforce.com` for sandbox orgs) |
| Email                          | Your Salesforce username (e.g., `user@company.com`)                                                          |
| Password + Security Token      | Your Salesforce password concatenated with your security token (e.g., `MyPassword123XXYYZZ`)                 |
| Objects                        | Comma-separated Salesforce object API names to sync (e.g., `Account, Contact, Opportunity, Case`). Leave blank for the defaults. |
| Advanced Object Config JSON    | Optional JSON for precise field and association control. Overrides the Objects field when provided.          |

Example advanced config:

```json
{
  "Lead": {
    "fields": ["FirstName", "LastName", "Company", "Email"],
    "associations": { "Account": ["Name"] }
  },
  "Case": {
    "fields": ["Subject", "Status", "Priority", "Description"]
  }
}
```

`Id`, `Name`, and `LastModifiedDate` are always included automatically.

## Web Crawler

Crawl static HTML pages from a documentation site or public web property.

**Indexed:** same-host HTML pages discovered from the start URL. The crawler extracts page text, removes common navigation and layout elements, and stores each page with its canonical URL when one is present.

**Authentication:** none in the initial version. The crawler only fetches pages reachable over HTTP(S).

Private and internal network addresses are blocked. Start URLs and discovered pages cannot resolve to loopback, link-local, RFC 1918 private ranges, cloud metadata endpoints, or other reserved address ranges. Hosts are checked before each fetch, but DNS records can change between validation and the final network request.

If the start URL is the site root, such as `https://example.com/`, and no include path prefixes are configured, the crawler can discover any same-host page within the configured depth and page limits.

| Field                 | Description                                                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start URL             | First page to crawl. Crawling stays on the same host.                                                    |
| Include Path Prefixes | Comma-separated paths to crawl, such as `/docs/` or `/guides/`. Defaults to the start URL path.          |
| Exclude Path Patterns | Comma-separated regular expressions matched against path and query, such as `/search` or `/archive/.*`. |
| Content Selector      | CSS selector for the page content root. Leave blank to use default document selectors.                   |
| Exclude Selectors     | Comma-separated CSS selectors to remove before extracting text, such as `.sidebar` or `.toc`.           |
| Max Pages             | Maximum pages to crawl in one sync (default: `250`).                                                     |
| Max Depth             | Maximum link depth from the start URL (default: `3`).                                                    |
| Batch Size            | Documents yielded per sync batch (default: `25`).                                                        |
| Request Delay         | Optional delay between requests, in milliseconds.                                                        |
| User Agent            | Optional custom User-Agent header for crawl requests.                                                    |

## Perforce (Helix Core)

Sync text files from Perforce Helix Core depot paths.

**Indexed:** files matching the configured extensions (defaults to `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`) under the configured depot paths, at their latest submitted revision. Files with non-text Perforce filetypes (binary, symlink, etc.) and files larger than 2 MB are skipped regardless of the extension list, so broadening the extensions (e.g. adding `.txt`, `.json`, or `.xml`) is safe even in depots that mix documentation with binary assets. Optional exclude paths carve subtrees (e.g. generated or vendored directories) out of the synced depot paths.

**Authentication:** a Perforce username with a login ticket, sent as HTTP basic authentication. The ticket must be valid for all hosts — generate it with `p4 login -a -p`. For long-lived access, use a service account whose group has an unlimited ticket timeout. The account needs read access to the configured depot paths.

The connector talks to the [P4 REST API](https://help.perforce.com/helix-core/server-apps/p4sag/current/Content/P4SAG/p4-rest-api.html), served by the built-in P4 web server. An administrator must start the web server on the P4 Server (`p4 webserver start -p <port>`; it serves HTTPS automatically when the server has an SSL certificate configured). The REST API is a Perforce Technology Preview feature (introduced with P4 Server 2025.2), so its behavior may change between server releases. No `p4` client binary and no client workspace (`P4CLIENT`) are required — files are listed and read directly in depot syntax over HTTP. For servers with self-signed certificates, provide the CA to the backend via standard Node.js trust configuration (`NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`).

Incremental syncs are driven by submitted changelist numbers: after the initial sync, only files changed since the last synced changelist are re-indexed. File deletions are not propagated on incremental syncs; use **Force re-sync** to rebuild the index after large depot restructurings.

Each depot path and extension combination is listed in its own REST API request. On very large depots, server `maxresults` limits or per-request response bounds can reject a listing; configure narrower depot paths if the initial sync fails while listing files.

| Field         | Description                                                                                            |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Server URL    | Base URL of the P4 REST API served by the P4 web server (e.g., `https://perforce.example.com:8080`)    |
| Depot Paths   | Comma-separated depot paths to sync recursively, in depot syntax (e.g., `//depot/docs`)                |
| Username      | The Perforce user (P4USER) the connector authenticates as                                               |
| Login Ticket  | An all-hosts ticket from `p4 login -a -p`                                                               |
| File Types    | Comma-separated file extensions to index (defaults to `.md`, `.yaml`, `.yml`)                           |
| Exclude Paths | Optional comma-separated depot paths skipped within the synced paths (e.g., `//depot/docs/generated`)  |

## Managing Connectors

Connectors can be managed from the **Connectors** page. Open a connector to:

- **Toggle enabled/disabled** -- suspends or resumes the cron schedule
- **Trigger sync** -- runs an immediate sync outside the schedule
- **View indexed documents** -- search and page through the documents produced by that connector, preview source content, and delete documents that should be removed before the next sync
- **View runs** -- see sync history with status, document counts, and errors
